.TH sigul 1 "Jan 2011" sigul

.SH name
sigul \- A client for accessing a signing server

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBsigul\fP [\fIOPTIONS\fP] [\fICOMMAND\fP [\fICOMMAND-ARGS...\fP]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Connects to a sigul server through a sigul bridge to perform \fICOMMAND\fP.

.SH OPTIONS
The global
.B sigul
.I OPTIONS
above are distinct from \fICOMMAND\fP-specific options.
Only options preceding
.I COMMAND
on the command line are treated as global \fIOPTIONS\fP.

.TP
.B \-\-help\-commands
List recognized \fICOMMAND\fPs.

.TP
.B \-\-batch
Be more suitable for batch processing:
Instead of reading passwords from \fB/dev/tty\fP,
read them from the standard input.
Each password on standard input is terminated by a NUL (0) byte.
The passwords are expected in the same order as when
.B \-\-batch
is not specified,
except that a new password is expected only once, not twice.

.TP
\fB\-c\fP, \fB\-\-config\-file\fP \fIPATH\fP
Use
.I PATH
as the per-user configuration file instead of \fB~/.sigul/client.conf\fR.

.TP
\fB\-u\fP, \fB\-\-user\-name \fIUSER\fP
Use
.I USER
as the user name sent to the server,
overriding the value set in the configuration file.

.TP
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP
Be more verbose.
Using this option twice enables debugging output.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.B sigul
returns with exit status 0 on success, non-zero on error.

.SH ADMINISTRATIVE COMMANDS
These commands are only available to signing server administrators,
identified with a personal password.

.TP
.B list\-users
List users recognized by the server.

.TP
\fBnew\-user\fP [\fB\-\-admin\fP] [\fB\-\-with\-password\fP] \fIUSER\fP
Add
.I USER
to the server.
The user will be a server administrator if
.B \-\-admin
is specified,
and will have a personal password defined if
.B \-\-with\-password
is specified.

.TP
\fBdelete\-user\fP \fIUSER\fP
Delete
.I USER
on the server.
This operation is allowed only after all key access right were revoked from
\fIUSER\fP.

.TP
\fBuser\-info\fP \fIUSER\fP
Show information about \fIUSER\fP.

.TP
\fBmodify\-user\fP [\fB\-\-admin\fP {\fByes\fP|\fBno\fP}] [\fB\-\-new\-name\fP \fINEW_NAME\fP] [\fB\-\-change\-password\fP] \fIUSER\fP
Modify
.I USER
according to the specified options.

.TP
\fBkey\-user\-info\fP \fIUSER\fP \fIKEY\fP
Show whether
.I USER
has access to
.I KEY
and whether the user is an administrator for this key.

.TP
\fBmodify\-key\-user\fP [\fB\-\-key\-admin\fP {\fByes\fP|\fBno\fP}] \fIUSER\fP \fIKEY\fP
Modify the access of
.I USER
to
.I KEY
according to the specified options.

.TP
.B list\-keys
List keys stored on the server.

.TP
\fBnew\-key\fP [\fB\-\-key\-admin\fP \fIUSER\fP] [\fB\-\-name\-real\fP \fIREAL_NAME\fP] [\fB\-\-name\-comment\fP \fICOMMENT\fP] [\fB\-\-name\-email\fP \fIEMAIL\fP] [\fB\-\-expire\-date\fP \fIYYYY\fP\fB-\fP\fIMM\fP\fB-\fP\fIDD\fP] \fIKEY\fP
Create a new key
.I KEY
on the server,
using the specified name and expiry information,
and write the public key to standard output.

If
.I USER
is specified,
make him the key administrator and only user instead of the invoking user.
This is only this user and the users this user grants access can use the key;
even signing server administrators can not use the key
without knowing a key passphrase of one of the authorized key users.

.TP
\fBimport\-key\fP [\fB\-\-key\-admin\fP \fIUSER\fP] \fIKEY\fP \fIKEY_FILE\fP
Import a public and private key from \fIKEY_FILE\fP to the server, naming it
\fIKEY\fP.

If
.I USER
is specified,
make him the key administrator and only user instead of the invoking user.
This is only this user and the users this user grants access can use the key;
even signing server administrators can not use the key
without knowing a key passphrase of one of the authorized key users.

.I KEY_FILE
should be created using the following command:
.RS
.RS
\fBgpg \-\-export\-secret\-key\fP \fIKEY_ID\fP \fB>\fP \fIKEY_FILE\fP
.RE
.RE

.TP
\fBdelete\-key\fP \fIKEY\fP

.I KEY
from the server.

.TP

identified with a key passphrase.
Some of the commands support a

List users that have access to \fIKEY\fP.

.TP
\fBgrant\-key\-access\fP \fIKEY\fP \fIUSER\fP
Grant access to
.I KEY
to \fIUSER\fP.

.TP
\fBrevoke\-key\-access\fP [\fB\-\-password\fP] \fIKEY\fP \fIUSER\fP
Revoke access to
.I KEY
from \fIUSER\fP.
This command can not revoke access from the last user of \fIKEY\fP:
you must delete
.I KEY
instead.

.SH USER COMMANDS
These commands are available to key users,
identified with a key passphrase.
Some of the commands support a
.B \-\-password

.I KEY
to standard output.

.TP
\fBchange\-passphrase\fP \fIKEY\fP

Each user has a separate passphrase for each
.I KEY
they have access to.

.TP
\fBsign-text\fP [\fB\-\-output\fP \fIOUTPUT\fP] \fIKEY\fP \fIINPUT_FILE\fP

is not defined,
write the signed text to standard output.

.TP
\fBsign-data\fP [\fB\-\-output\fP \fIOUTPUT\fP] \fIKEY\fP \fIINPUT_FILE\fP
Create a detached signature for
.I INTPUT_FILE
and write it to \fIOUTPUT\fP.
If
.I OUTPUT
is not defined,
write the signed text to standard output,

.TP
\fBsign-rpm\fP [\fB\-\-output\fP \fIOUTPUT\fP] [\fB\-\-store\-in\-koji\fP] [\fB\-\-koji\-only\fP] [\fB\-\-koji\-instance\fP \fIINSTANCE\fP] [\fB\-\-v3\-signature\fP] \fIKEY\fP \fIRPM_ID\fP
Sign the rpm specified by \fIRPM_ID\fP.
.I RPM_ID
can either be a path to a RPM file, or a
\fIname\fP\fB-\fP\fIepoch\fP\fB:\fP\fIversion\fP\fB-\fP\fIrelease\fP\fB.\fP\fIarch\fP
string
that specifies a RPM stored in Koji.

If
.B \-\-store\-in\-koji
is specified,
store the generated signature to Koji.
Unless
.B \-\-koji\-only
is specified,
write a signed RPM file to \fIOUTPUT\fP,
and if
.I OUTPUT
is not defined,
write it to standard output,

The
.I \-\-koji\-instance
option can be used to perform the operation using a different Koji instance,
if it was set up in the configuration files of both the client and the bridge.

Use a PGP version 3 format signatue if
.B \-\-v3\-signature
is specified.

.TP
\fBsign-rpms\fP [\fB\-\-output\fP \fIDIR\fP] [\fB\-\-store\-in\-koji\fP] [\fB\-\-koji\-only\fP] [\fB\-\-koji\-instance\fP \fIINSTANCE\fP] [\fB\-\-v3\-signature\fP] \fIKEY\fP \fIRPM_ID...\fP
Sign one or more rpms specified by \fIRPM_ID\fP.
Each
.I RPM_ID
can either be a path to a RPM file, or a
\fIname\fP\fB-\fP\fIepoch\fP\fB:\fP\fIversion\fP\fB-\fP\fIrelease\fP\fB.\fP\fIarch\fP
string
that specifies a RPM stored in Koji.

If
.B \-\-store\-in\-koji
is specified,
store the generated signature to Koji.
If
.B \-\-koji\-only
is not specified,
the
.B \-\-output
option is mandatory,
and each signed RPM will be stored as a file in the \fIDIR\fP directory.

The
.I \-\-koji\-instance
option can be used to perform the operation using a different Koji instance,
if it was set up in the configuration files of both the client and the bridge.

Use a PGP version 3 format signatue if
.B \-\-v3\-signature
is specified.

.SH FILES
.TP
.B @configdir@/client.conf
A system-wide configuration file.

.TP
