Signing Server
--

See http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/ReleaseEngineering/Projects/SigningServer

For testing development, execute xmlrpcserver.py.  Then use client.py to
connect and test various methods.  Currently client.py takes a keyemail and
a list of package paths to sign.  It will also clearsign some hard set
content just to test that code path.
