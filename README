Signing Server
--

See http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/ReleaseEngineering/Projects/SigningServer

For testing development, import the signserv.sec gpg key, and make sure your 
gpg config does not make use of any agents.  Then execute xmlrpcserver.py.  
It will run indefinitely, kill it with ^c.
Then use client.py to connect and test various methods.  Currently client.py 
takes a keyemail and a list of package paths to sign.  It will also clearsign 
some hard set content just to test that code path.
