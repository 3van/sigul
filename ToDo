Design questions

Do we use koji style "client <glob-opts> command <command-opts>" or a more
simple "client <options> --command"?

How do we keep the server stuff generic enough to be useful with other clients
that may or may not make use of koji, but still prevent passing whole rpms
from being passed around?
