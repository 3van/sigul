  New bridge and server options max-rpms-payload-size.
- Server option gnupg-key-usage has changed default to "sign" (removing

  signing is all that is necessary anyway.

- New server option signing-timeout
- New sigul_server_add_admin parameters --batch , --name

  to overwrite an existing certificate.

- Work with post-RHEL5 URLGrabber
