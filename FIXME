- should be able to service requests within the server in parallel?
- better bridge error reporting - fake reply header, handle it in the client
- rewrite to send as large chunks of data at a time as possible (decreases TLS
  framing overhead, removes wakeups/context switches)
- Koji "pkgurl" is obsolete, need to replace this (ONLY IF the Fedora
  infrastructure can handle it)
  Seems we'll need (koji.pathinfo.build(build)+'/'+koji.pathinfo.rpm(rpm_info)),
  and to manually configure koji.pathinfo with topurl from config
